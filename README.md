- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for lovely data management
- [React-Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) ... for routing
- [React-Router-Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) for syncing routes with store
- [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) enabled for debugging
